# dchip

This is a D2 port of the [Chipmunk2D](http://chipmunk2d.net/) library.

**Note:** Currently dchip is in a pre-alpha state.
Once it's tested on multiple platforms a `dub` package will be added.

## Authors

This D2 port has been created by [Andrej Mitrovic].

The older v5.3.5 port was created by [Stephan Dilly],
and is being maintained here: https://bitbucket.org/Extrawurst/chipmunkd/wiki/Home

**Note:** The two ports are **not** backward-compatible with each other.

Samples were created by [Stephan Dilly], and updated to the new API by [Andrej Mitrovic].

which will allow building in a cross-platform way.
