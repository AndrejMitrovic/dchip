# dchip

This is a D2 port of the Chipmunk2D library.

**Note:** Currently dchip is in a pre-alpha state.
Once it's fully tested  on multiple platforms a `dub` package will be added.

## Authors

This D2 port has been created by Andrej Mitrovic.

The older v5.3.5 port was created by Stephan Dilly, www.extrawurst.org,
and is being maintained here: https://bitbucket.org/Extrawurst/chipmunkd/wiki/Home

**Note:** The two ports are **not** backward-compatible with each other.

Samples were created by Stephan Dilly, and updated to the new API by Andrej Mitrovic.

## Building

Currently only `build.bat` files are provided. A dub package will be added later
which will allow building in a cross-platform way.
