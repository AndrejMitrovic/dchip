Todo:

- Introduce DUB package.
- Add some missing documentation from the C sources and fix them so they match D semantics.
- Add documentation building (probably through DUB).
- Port test-suite to GLFW.
- Diff the test-suite of v6.2.1 and v5.3.5 and add missing tests.
- See the Box2D test-suite and port some of the interesting samples to our test-suite.
